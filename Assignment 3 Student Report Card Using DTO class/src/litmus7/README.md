Assignment 3 - Student Report Card Generator (DTO Version)

This Java console application uses the **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** pattern to model student data and generate report cards.

## Project Description
The project collects student details like name, roll number, and subject marks. It calculates total marks, average marks, and assigns a grade based on the average. The code follows good design practices by using:

- DTO class (`Student.java`) for holding data
- Service class (`Studentservices.java`) for processing logic
- Application class (`StudentApp.java`) for user interaction
